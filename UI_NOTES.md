UI/UX polish applied:
- Combined Ultra-Modern Minimal + Elegant Wedding theme tokens (soft off-white, soft pink, gold accents).
- Tailwind tokens + custom UI CSS in styles/ui.css.
- Header/Footer, Hero, Card, Feed Masonry, FeedCard components created with accessible attributes.
- Responsive grid and masonry for feed; focus outlines for keyboard nav; high-contrast text and ARIA roles where appropriate.
- Buttons and tags use the wedding color palette and larger tap targets for mobile usability.

Next developer steps:
1. Install dependencies including lucide-react, @radix-ui/react-dialog (if using shadcn patterns), and tailwind via npm.
2. Ensure Tailwind is configured and PostCSS installed in the project.
3. Replace placeholder images and wire the icons library (lucide) into components.
4. Add localized font files or Google Fonts imports (Limelight, Inter).
5. Run the app and iterate on spacing breakpoints for exact pixel perfection.
